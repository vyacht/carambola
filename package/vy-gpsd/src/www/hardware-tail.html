<h2 id="timing">PPS and GPSD:</h2>

<p>Some GPS receivers offer a 1PPS (one pulse per second) output that
GPSD is capable of passing along to <code>ntpd</code> for use as an
extremely accurate clock source.  The "Claimed Accuracy" figures are taken
from manufacturers' data sheets, and have not been independently
verified.</p>

<p>Where specified, NTP time offsets have been measured by
comparison with the NTP time service and reported by
<code>gpsd</code>.</p>

<p>Note that either a direct RS-232 connection or the "Magic Macx mod"
(1PPS on the GPS chip connected to DCD on the serial-to-USB adaptor)
is required for PPS. Typical gpsd/PPS users report ntp clock stability
on the order of 1&mu;s (microsecond) for RS232, 1ms (millisecond) for
USB.  From GPSes that are native USB but not PPS-capable, GPSD can
extract time information from the serial data accurate to about
250ms.</p>

<p>Most PPS accuracy information has been moved to the main hardware
table. The following table collects some statistics on older PPS-
capable devices for which we don't have full information.</p>

<h2>Raw Measurements and GPSD:</h2>

<p>All gpses require "raw" measurements internally to compute a navigation
  solution. The ability for users to postprocess these measurements is then
  a function of firmware and protocol support.</p>
